These are the resources for the MATH 322 reading group. It is heavily recommended that you read through the reading sets before going to the session. A deep understanding of the reading sets are not required, but you should at least have a look over the content. We will assume that everyone has seen the reading set and build off of the content on the reading set. Solutions to problems in the practice set as well as notes for the reading sessions are posted soon after the reading sessions are over.
